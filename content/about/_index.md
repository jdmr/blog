Hello, I've worked as a software engineer for 20+ years with Java as my primary language. A couple of years ago I picked up Go(lang) and I've stopped doing any new development on Java.

Started doing web development since 1999 with Servlets and JSP's, built my own web framework but moved to the Spring Framework as soon as it came out. As of late I been working with VueJS for my frontend and Go for my backend (no Java).

And for mobile I started with Ionic due to my HTML/CSS/JS background and didn't want to be building an Apple and a Google version, but found the build and deployment process rather painful. Looking for alternatives found Flutter! This tool is great! I moved my current apps into it and building some new ones with it and it's just wonderful to develop mobile with it.
