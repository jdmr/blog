Keeping on with this year's resolution, I've decided to write about my experience with writing a small Flutter app.

So when I'm writting an application I try to find different posts about what I'm going to do and start using the ones that I understand the most. This project I based it out of David Chea's [Flutter: How to do user login with Firebase](https://medium.com/flutterpub/flutter-how-to-do-user-login-with-firebase-a6af760b14d5), basically his [github repo](https://github.com/tattwei46/flutter_login_demo).

Once you have setup your computer to do [Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install), you're ready to open a terminal and run

```bash
flutter create --org com.example login_demo
```

So now you're application is going to be com.example.login_demo. And you'll need that when you create your app both for IOS and/or Android.
